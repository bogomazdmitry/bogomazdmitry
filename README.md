## Hi there, I'm Dmitry Bogomaz ðŸ‘‹

I am a Backend C++ developer working at Yandex Go.

### Main Languages

- **C++** is for work and LeetCode
- **Go/Python** are also for work and pet projects
- **C#** comes from previous work
- **TS/JS** are for the soul
- **Java** is from university

### My Active Projects

1. **work-tool** [[repo](https://github.com/bogomazdmitry/work-tool)][[site](https://bogomazdmitry.github.io/work-tool)]  
   A web app for fast text operations: diff, decode, encode, and format.
2. **money-counter** [[repo](https://github.com/bogomazdmitry/money-counter)][[bot](https://t.me/MoneyCounterHelperBot)]  
   A simple bot for counting money with balances.

### My Main Archive Projects

1. **note-shared** [[repo](https://github.com/bogomazdmitry/note-shared)]  
   A Google Keep clone for storing notes. It was just an educational project for me, so I stopped developing it.
2. **multi-microsoft-teams** [[repo](https://github.com/bogomazdmitry/multi-microsoft-teams)]  
   A Windows desktop app for opening two or more Microsoft Teams instances separately. I forked the project, added the ability to choose the app for links, and fixed the autostart feature.
3. **calculator-stm32f4** [[repo](https://github.com/bogomazdmitry/calculator-stm32f4)]  
   My friend and I created a simple calculator using FreeRTOS. You can check the video in the project README.
